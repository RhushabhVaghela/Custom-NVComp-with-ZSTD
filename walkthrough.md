# Walkthrough

## Completed Work
- Generated **codebase_analysis_report.md** summarizing repository structure, TODO/FIXME scan (none found), and detailed test suite failures.
- Produced **coverage_report.md** outlining why coverage data is missing and providing concrete steps to enable and collect coverage.
- Updated **task.md** checklist to reflect completed phases and marked **Test Coverage Expansion** as in‑progress.
- Created this walkthrough documenting the analysis and next actions.

## Verification
- Files `codebase_analysis_report.md` and `coverage_report.md` have been created in the repository root.
- The task checklist (`task.md`) now shows completed items for exploration, analysis, and identification steps.

## Next Steps (for the user)
1. **Address test crashes** – follow the recommendations in the analysis report (use `cuda‑memcheck`, enable debug symbols, etc.).
2. **Enable coverage flags** in the CMake configuration and re‑run the test suite.
3. **Generate coverage reports** using `gcov`/`llvm‑cov` as described in `coverage_report.md`.
4. **Update the task checklist** once the above actions are completed.
