Compressible Data Validation Tests
========================================

Objective: Prove system DOES compress when given compressible data
Context: benchmark_lz77 showed 'zero sequences' with random data


=== Testing: Repeated Text (64KB) ===
Input size: 65536 bytes
[DEBUG] compress: Block 0 has num_sequences=527
[DEBUG] compress: Calling build_sequences for block 0 with num_sequences=527\n[DEBUG] First 5 sequences: [LL=528,ML=128,OF=180] [LL=47,ML=128,OF=450] [LL=88,ML=128,OF=720] [LL=66,ML=128,OF=180] [LL=220,ML=128,OF=1035] 
✅ Compressed: 9527 bytes
✅ Compression ratio: 6.88:1
✅ Round-trip verified!
✅ Repeated text test PASSED

=== Testing: JSON Pattern (64KB) ===
Input size: 65536 bytes
